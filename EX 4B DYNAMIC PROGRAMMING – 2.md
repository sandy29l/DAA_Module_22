## AIM:
To find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings..

## Algorithm:
```
1.Create a 2D table lookup of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of strings X and Y, respectively.
2.Initialize maxLength as 0 and endingIndex as m to store the end index of the longest common substring.
3.Loop through each character of both strings (X[i-1] and Y[j-1]):
4.If the characters match, update lookup[i][j] = lookup[i-1][j-1] + 1.
5.If the characters don't match, set lookup[i][j] = 0.
6.Track the maximum length found and update maxLength and endingIndex accordingly.
7.The longest common substring is the substring of X that starts from endingIndex - maxLength and ends at endingIndex.
```
## Program:

            if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:
                lookup[i][j] = lookup[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                if lookup[i][j] > maxLength:
                    maxLength = lookup[i][j]
                    endingIndex = i
    return X[endingIndex - maxLength: endingIndex]

    X = input()
    Y = input()
    m = len(X)
    n = len(Y)
    print('The longest common substring is', LCS(X, Y, m, n))

```
